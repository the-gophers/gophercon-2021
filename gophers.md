## Aaron Schlesinger

I work at Microsoft as a cloud developer advocate. In my role, I spend almost all my time contributing to open source projects related to [Go](https://go.dev), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), and [Cloud Native](https://cncf.io) technologies.

## Aaron Wislang

I am a Gopher and Cloud Advocate at Microsoft with a focus on Go and Cloud Native. Alongside Go, I love working with Linux and Open Source, Containers, Kubernetes, and Python. I currently live in Toronto, Canada with my wife and our two boys.

Please feel free to chat to me about _anything_ Go or Cloud Native related at Microsoft, as well as any of our open source projects such as [KEDA](https://github.com/kedacore/keda), the [KEDA HTTP Add-On](https://github.com/kedacore/http-add-on), [Dapr](https://github.com/dapr/dapr), etc...
