## Aaron Schlesinger

I am a Principal Cloud Advocate at Microsoft. I spend the majority of my time contributing to [KEDA](https://github.com/kedacore/keda) and the [KEDA HTTP Addon](https://github.com/kedacore/http-add-on). I also created the [Athens project](https://github.com/gomods/athens). My focus is generally Go, Kubernetes and other Cloud Native technologies.

## Aaron Wislang

I am a Gopher and Cloud Advocate at Microsoft with a focus on Go and Cloud Native. Alongside Go, I love working with Linux and Open Source, Containers, Kubernetes, and Python. I currently live in Toronto, Canada with my wife and our two boys.

Please feel free to chat to me about _anything_ Go or Cloud Native related at Microsoft, as well as any of our open source projects such as [KEDA](https://github.com/kedacore/keda), the [KEDA HTTP Add-On](https://github.com/kedacore/http-add-on), [Dapr](https://github.com/dapr/dapr), etc...

## Abhidnya Patil 

I work at Microsoft as a Software Engineer in Azure Identity. I started my Go journey roughly about a year ago to work on the development of a [Go SDK](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-go) for Azure App Developers to integrate to the Microsoft Identity Platform for all authentication scenarios. I have loved working on open source projects here at Microsoft and love the community I get to be a part of as a Gopher. 

Feel free to chat with me if you want to know more about the project I work on or are interested in contrubuting or just want to say hi to a fairly new Gopher.

I work at Microsoft as a Senior Software Engineer for Application delivery team in Azure Networking. I became a Gopher 2 years ago when I started contributing and leading [Application Gateway Ingress Controller](https://github.com/Azure/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress) which is a Go-based Kubernetes ingress controller. Right now, I am using Go, C# and Cloud-Native principles to build the next generation of delivery services for Azure. When not gophering around, I am usually found in a nearby climbing gym practicing bouldering and top roping (and some yoga).
