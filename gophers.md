## Aaron Wislang

I am a Gopher and Cloud Advocate at Microsoft with a focus on Go and Cloud Native. Alongside Go, I love working with Linux and Open Source, Containers, Kubernetes, and Python. I have been writing Go since <...>, my first in-person Go conference was GopherCon 2018. I currently live in Toronto, Canada with my wife and our two boys.

Please feel free to chat to me about _anything_ Go or Cloud Native related at Microsoft, as well as any of our open source projects such as [KEDA](https://github.com/kedacore/keda), the [KEDA HTTP Add-On](https://github.com/kedacore/http-add-on), [Dapr](https://github.com/dapr/dapr), etc...

## Abhidnya Patil 

I work at Microsoft as a Software Engineer in Azure Identity. I started my Go journey roughly about a year ago to work on the development of a [Golang SDK](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-go) for Azure App Developers to integrate to the Microsoft Identity Platform for all authentication scenarios. I have loved working on open source projects here at Microsoft and love the community I get to be a part of as a Gopher. 

Feel free to chat with me if you want to know more about the project I work on or are interested in contrubuting or just want to say hi to a fairly new Gopher.
